**A Simple Trivia Quiz App**

A Trivia app that asks random questions.
All answer's are multiple choice . You're score is generated as you go. If you are not happy with your score you can try again ! 


**App Architecture & Structure**


- **Model-View-Modelview** design to seperate concern's and account for configurtation changes.


-  **Fragments** to display different views and to keep app light weight with only one activity.


- **Observer Pattern** with LiveData to make sure our UI displayed the latest data. 


-  **Repository Pattern**  Decouples the business logic from data access layers.


- **View Binding** to populates views with most current data
