**A Simple Trivia Quiz App**

A Trivia app that asks random questions.
All answer's are multiple choice . You're score is generated as you go. If you are not happy with your score you can try again ! 


**App Architecture & Structure**


Used **Model-View-Modelview** design to seperate concern's and account for configurtation changes.


Used Multiple **Fragments** and 1 Activity.


Used **Observer Pattern** with LiveData to make sure our UI displayed the latest data. 


Used a **DataRepository** to keep all a-like data from a source coupled.
